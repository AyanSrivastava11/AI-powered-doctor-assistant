      "It's important to remember that I am an AI and **cannot provide medical diagnoses or advice.** The symptoms you describe (fever, cough, fatigue) are very common and can be associated with a wide range of conditions. Only a healthcare professional can accurately diagnose your condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, based on these symptoms, here are some common possibilities and general advice:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Diseases:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Common Cold:** A mild viral infection of the nose and throat.\n",
      "    *   **Symptoms:** Usually milder, with a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, sneezing, and a mild cough, often accompanied by low-grade fever and fatigue.\n",
      "2.  **Influenza (Flu):** A more severe viral infection.\n",
      "    *   **Symptoms:** Often comes on suddenly with high fever, body aches, headaches, chills, significant fatigue, and a dry cough.\n",
      "3.  **COVID-19:** A respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n",
      "    *   **Symptoms:** Highly variable, but commonly includes fever, cough (often dry), fatigue, shortness of breath, body aches, sore throat, headache, and sometimes loss of taste or smell.\n",
      "4.  **Acute Bronchitis:** Inflammation of the bronchial tubes, often viral, but can sometimes be bacterial.\n",
      "    *   **Symptoms:** Persistent cough (can produce mucus), chest discomfort, fatigue, and sometimes a low-grade fever.\n",
      "5.  **Pneumonia:** An infection that inflames air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus. Can be viral or bacterial.\n",
      "    *   **Symptoms:** Cough (often with phlegm), fever, chills, fatigue, and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.\n",
      "6.  **Other Viral Infections:** Such as RSV, parainfluenza, or adenovirus, which can cause similar cold/flu-like symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Advice While Monitoring Symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Rest:** Get plenty of sleep and avoid strenuous activities. Rest helps your body fight off infection.\n",
      "2.  **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids like water, clear broths, herbal teas, and electrolyte solutions. This helps prevent dehydration, especially with fever.\n",
      "3.  **Over-the-Counter Medications:**\n",
      "    *   **Fever and Pain:** Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help reduce fever and alleviate body aches. Follow dosage instructions carefully.\n",
      "    *   **Cough:** Over-the-counter cough suppressants or expectorants might provide some relief, depending on the type of cough.\n",
      "    *   **Congestion:** Decongestants or saline nasal sprays can help with a stuffy nose if present.\n",
      "4.  **Monitor Your Symptoms:** Keep track of how your symptoms change, if they worsen, or if new symptoms appear.\n",
      "5.  **Prevent Spread:**\n",
      "    *   **Stay Home:** Avoid contact with others to prevent spreading potential illness.\n",
      "    *   **Hand Hygiene:** Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing or sneezing.\n",
      "    *   **Cover Coughs/Sneezes:** Use a tissue or your elbow.\n",
      "    *   **Wear a Mask:** If you must be around others, wearing a mask can help reduce transmission.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.**\n",
      "*   **Persistent pain or pressure in the chest.**\n",
      "*   **New confusion or inability to rouse.**\n",

      "*   **Severe or persistent vomiting.**\n",
      "*   **Symptoms that are worsening significantly.**\n",
      "*   **High fever (e.g., above 103°F or 39.4°C) that doesn't respond to medication.**\n",
      "*   **Fever that lasts more than 3-4 days.**\n",
      "*   **Symptoms that do not improve after several days of self-care.**\n",
      "*   **If you have underlying health conditions** (e.g., asthma, diabetes, heart disease, compromised immune system) or are elderly, you may be at higher risk for complications and should consult a doctor sooner.\n",
